## Installation
Check the latest version on the [Release](https://github.com/Blatke/Heels-with-Tight---HS2-AIS-mod/releases) page and download the mod file. Put the .zipmod file into directory **/mods/** .

In Chara Maker mode, go to Outfit panel, add Shoes to the chara, and search for "blake", "heels" or "tight" in the selection box to find it. 
Then, add it to the shoes.

Use MaterialEditor to adjust its color, glossiness, metallic values as well as the main texture and normal maps.

For the maps, the transparent (alpha channel) part on the texture will be culled to appear the chara's body.

## In StudioNeo
When playing with the chara wearing Heels with Tight in StudioNeo, if some poses result in clipping between the chara and the tight, you can select the chara and enable its adv.mode of HS2PE/AIPE, go with Blend Shapes tab, choose the Tight block, and then, drag the slider of the Fatter to make the tight fatter till it doesn't clip with the chara.

Another way to avoid clipping is to turn OFF this option to disbale the renderer of the chara's body, so the body will not be rendered.

Also, there is a Smoothness block on Blend Shapes tab. It helps when the toes is rotated and let the heads of the heels not be smooth.
